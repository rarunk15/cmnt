The Carnatic Music Transliterator allows you to create text for carnatic music 
compositions in a "unified" transliteration scheme so that it can be 
effectively rendered in all the carnatic music languages (sanskrit, telugu, tamizh, kannada
and malayalam).  See <a href="/cmtranslit/cmtranslit_scheme.html" target="Scheme">Unified Transliteration Scheme for Carnatic
Music Compositions</a> for more information on the scheme.
<h3><a id="Usage" name="Usage"></a>General Usage</h3>
You can either start typing from scratch, or you can paste HTML or word content. Use the various
formatting buttons on top to create text in <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <u>underline</u>, and also
to create bullet list, numbered lists, headings etc. As mentioned above, the text is expected to be
in the <a href="/cmtranslit/cmtranslit_scheme.html" target="Scheme">unified transliteration scheme for carnatic music</a>
<p>
Once you have created the text, you use the
<img style="background-color:#c0c0c0;border:1px solid #000000;" align="top" src="images/translate.png"></img> button to 
translate to the various languages. Use the tabs on top to switch between different languages
<table>
    <tr>
	<td>
</table>
</p>
<p>
<h4>Paragraphs (RETURN) and newlines (Shift+RETURN)</h4>
When entering text, if you press the RETURN key, the editor will create a new 
paragraph. If you instead want to new just a new line without the additional space 
taken by paragraph, press Shift key while pressing the RETURN key.
<h3><a id="Printing" name="Printing"></a>Printable View, Printinng</h3>
Once you have translated the transliteration text to the target languages, you can switch to a printable view
using the <b>Printable View</b> link the bottom. This view includes only the contents for the
selected language(s), which you can then print to your printer using the print options of the browser. 
<h4>Getting back to the editor - the Back link</h4>
The printable view, includes a <b>Back</b> link to take you back to the editor. You should use
this link and <u>not</u> the Back button of your browser.  Note that as desired, the <b>Back</b> link 
will not be included in your hard copy print.
<h4>Including more than one language in printable view</h4>
By default, the printable view will include the translation for the currently selected target language. So,
if you are currently viewing Telugu, and you click on the <b>Printable View</b> link, the printable
view will include only the Telugu rendition. You can include multiple languages, and also control the 
order in which the languages appear by changing the print options. 
<p>
To view the print options,
click on the <span class="optbutton">+</span> button next to the <b>Printable View</b> link. This will show two lists
side by side with two buttons <span class="optbutton">&gt;&gt;</span> and <span class="optbutton">&lt;&lt;</span>
in-between. The left side list contains all the languages including a special entry <i>&lt;Current&gt;</i> to
indicate the currently selected language. The right side list contains the languages that will be included
in the printable view in the order they appear in the list. Use the <span class="optbutton">&gt;&gt;</span>
button to add a language to the printable view. Use the <span class="optbutton">&lt;&lt;</span>
button to remove a language from the printable view.
<h3><a id="Variables" name="Variables"></a>Variables - what are they and how to use them</h3>
Some common terms which appear in carnatic music books <b>outside</b> of the
actual lyrics (i.e. sAhitya) have various spelling and pronounciations in the different languages.
For example, "Raga" (as in raga of the krithi), is rAga in kannada but rAgam in 
tamizh. So if you enter it as rAga in the input, then the translation would be inappropriate for tamizh as
it would appear as <span class="indic">&#x0BB0;&#x0BBE;&#x0B95;</span> in tamizh. On the other hand, if you specify it
as rAgam, then it would appear as <span class="indic">&#x0CB0;&#x0CBE;&#x0C97;&#x0C82;</span>, which is less than ideal than
<span class="indic">&#x0CB0;&#x0CBE;&#x0C97;</span>. There are many many examples of such terms in this category:
<ul>
    <li> The term for language as in of a krithi (<b>bAsha</b> in sanskrit, kannada, but <b>bashai</b> or 
    the better <b>mozhi</b> in tamizh), 
    <li> Names of composers such as <b>tyAgarAja</b> (which would be spelt as <b>tiyAgarAjar</b> in tamizh)
    <lb> Some raga names  like AbhOgi (<b>abhOgi</b> in kannada, telugu), kAmbhOji (<b>kAmbOdi</b> in tamizh)
</ul>
<p>
<u>Currently, the list of variables are pre-defined, and only a handful are supported at this
point </u>
<p>
To solve this problem, the editor has the concept of a <b>variable</b>, which is a term in
the input that translates to different words according to the language.  There are several ways of 
introducing variables into the content that needs to be transliterated. 
<h4><a id="InsertVariables" name="InsertVariables"></a>How to insert a variable</h4>
To insert a variable at the current location, you click on the 
<img class="button" align="top" src="images/cmlangterms.png"></img>
button. This will bring up a window from which you can select the variable you want to insert. The inserted
variable will be shown in blue text with a gray background (e.g. <span class="cmvar">rAga</span>).
<h4><a id="ConvertToVariable" name="ConvertToVariable"></a>How to convert normal text to a variable</h4>
If you have already entered in a text, you can tell the editor to convert it into a variable by
clicking on <img class="button" align="top" src="images/cvtlangterm.png"></img> button. The editor
will grab the current word, and search the list of pre-defined variables for a match. It will
compare the current word against the english transliteration for <u>all</u> of the languages
for a match. If a match is found, it will transform the current word into a variable (which
will turn it into bluex text against a gray background). 
<p>
Note that the text in the english translation, would be the text you entered. This points at
an advantage of using the <img class="button" align="top" src="images/cvtlangterm.png"></img>
button vs. the <img class="button" align="top" src="images/cmlangterms.png"></img> button
in that you have more control over how the text appears in the english "translation". For 
example, for the the variable for raga, if you use the <img class="button" src="images/cmlangterms.png"></img> 
button, the english text will always be rAga. However, with this approach, your input text could be any one of
rAga, raga, Raga, rAgam, rAgamu etc., and all these will convert to the same variable, and the english 
"translation" will retain the original text.
<h4><a id="ConvertAllToVar" name="ConvertAllToVar"></a>Find and replace suitable words to variables</h4>: If you are pasting text from an existing 
source, then it may be convenient to click on the <img class="button" align="top" src="images/cvtlangtermsall.png"></img> button. This will
search the text for words that are suitable for translation to variables.  This can save the trouble of
figuring out which words in your text should be variables.  Words that are suitable are ones that appear in bold 
amongst themselves, as in the context of headings, and also words in a certain form (e.g. Raga: i.e. a word that 
matches a variable value and is followed by a colon). 
<p>
Of course, using the <img class="button" align="top" src="images/cvtlangtermsall.png">
may not always work flawlessly, in which case you can use the other approaches to insert new variables,
and convert individual words to variables.
<h3><a id="Miscellaneous" name="Miscellaneous"</a>Miscellanous</h3>
<h4>Remove hyperlinks</h4>
If you are pasting text from an existing HTML source (as in a web-page), you may
want to remove the anchors which are usually shown underlined in a browser, which you may not want in
your transliterated content. You can do this by clicking on the 
<img class="button" align="top" src="../../themes/advanced/images/cleanup.gif"></img> button.
<h4>Clear Contents</h4>
Use <img class="button" align="top" src="../../themes/advanced/images/newdocument.gif"></img> button to
clear the contents of the editor.
