<h3><a name="top"></a>Synopsis</h3>
The <i>Unified transliteration Scheme for Carnatic Music Compositions</i> is an
English transliteration scheme for representing lyrics of Carnatic Music 
compositions in the Indic languages the Sanskrit, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and 
Malayalam, the five languages used in Carnatic Music. (<i>Malayalam not yet fully supported in the scheme</i>).

<h3>Introduction</h3>
The primary goals of the scheme are
<ol>
    <li>Aid fans and practioneers of carnatic music to grasp the 
    pronounciation of compositions as accurately as possible.
<ol>
    <li>A secondary goal of the scheme is that it should be easy to read in 
    english, and hence it aims towards a fair phonetic representation of the 
    underlying pronounciation - although within the limitations and 
    constraints of (a) the capability of the english language to represent
    these sounds, (b) conformance to established but not necessarily 
    phonetically accurate spellings for popular words/combinations, and 
    (c) conformance to the most common already established transliteration 
    rules, which again may not be phonetically accurate.
    <li>While writing text in the scheme, a general rule of thumb to 
    follow is <i>try to represent the underlying sound of the word, and 
    not how the word is written in a specific target language</i>
</ol>
<li>Enable those carnatic music fans to view the text of the compositions in 
any of any of the five target Indic languages. The assumption is that many 
Carnatic Music fans and practitioneers may relate better to lyrics represented
in their native language even for compositions in a different language.
</ol>
An immediate implication of Goal #1 is that the scheme should be able to 
represent the sounds of all the languages. A not so obvious implication of 
Goal #2, is that the scheme should be such that, a <b>single representation of 
a composition</b> should be renderable in all the five languages. This 
provides the reason for the "unified" part of the scheme.
<p>
This makes the scheme markedly different from the common transliteration 
schemes already in existence for these languages. All those schemes have a 
primary (if not always explicitly stated) and overriding goal of being able to 
unambigiously represent the target language in the transliteration source. 
This invariable leads to script specific idiosyncracies right in the 
transliteration scheme itself (explained later below). This of course means 
that a text in this scheme is of little use to people who dont know the 
language, as they would not be able to grasp the pronounciation from the 
english transliteration text. This in turn makes it harder for people (who 
know different languages) to share lyrical information in an effective manner. 
<p>
The unified scheme strives to avoid language script specific idiosyncracies as 
much as possible. For a sound (phoneme) that is common to all languages, there 
is almost always a single representation in the scheme and thus no matter
which language it figures in, a reader who understands the scheme should be
able to grasp the pronounciation.  In some cases, for ease of use, the
scheme does allow for various ways of specifying a particular sound (or 
combination of sounds). In all these cases, one way would be a preferred 
language neutral way, and the other that may be specific one or more target
languages. Using the latter representation will usually not affect translation 
to other languages, and hence can be used, but it is not preferred as it may 
make the input text "less phonetic" and hence harder for people who do not 
know the specific target language to grasp the underlying pronounciation.
<p>
Another big difference between this scheme and standard schemes is that this 
scheme requires a "smarter" transliteration engine to apply language specific 
rules. In fact, this requirement is the reason why the scheme itself is able 
to rid itself of script specific idiosyncracies, and also be able to be easy 
to read.
<h4>Conformance to common existing transliteration scheme rules</h4>
As stated above, the transliteration scheme is intended to be <i>as phonetic 
based as possible</i> (i.e. phonetic in english) as possible. However, it 
adheres to most of the already accepted norms such as A, E, I, O, U for 
long vowels; t vs T, d vs D for softer vs harder consonants etc. These norms 
are not phonetically ideal but they are nevertheless fairly well established 
amongst most if not all existing schemes for the target languages. The scheme
conforms to these norms as it is expected that most consumers would be
familiar to those norms.
<p>
<h4>Avoidance of language specific artifacts</h4>
Here are some examples of how the scheme avoids language specific artifacts:
<ul>
<li>In words like <i>candra</i>, languages such as Kannada, Telugu etc. 
include the anuswara instead of standard <i>na</i> consonant. Standard 
transliteration schemes may require this to be explicitly specified such 
as <i>caMdra</i>. The presence of the anuswara does not affect the 
pronounciation and hence the change makes the transliterated text be a "less 
fair" representation phonetically. Also, the anuswara is not needed in all 
languages - e.g. as in Tamil. In the scheme below, the above word can simply 
be specified as <i>candra</i> (it can actually also be specified as 
<i>caMdra</i>). In almost all cases, there is no need to explicitly specify 
the anuswara, and the engine will automatically figure out where it is 
applicable.</li>
<li>Similarly <i>pArtasArati</i> is rendered in Tamil as
<span class="indic">&#x0BAA;&#x0BBE;&#x0BB0;&#x0BCD;&#x0BA4;&#x0BCD;&#x0BA4;&#x0B9A;&#x0BBE;&#x0BB0;&#x0BA4;&#x0BBF;</span>, as Tamil requires the extra 
<i>t</i>(<span class="indic">&#x0BA4;&#x0BCD;</span>) after <i>pAr</i> 
(<span class="indic">&#x0BAA;&#x0BBE;&#x0BB0;&#x0BCD;</span>) to make the 
following <span class="indic">&#x0ba4;</span> take the harder sound (i.e. 
<i>t</i> as opposed to <i>d</i>. Standard schemes require this to explicitly 
specified such as <i>pArttasArati</i>. This is not required here and the text 
can remain as <i>pArtasArati</i> making it easily translatable to other Indic 
languages that do not require the extra character.</li>
<li>Consider the word <i>sundari</i>. Standard Telugu, Kannada schemes
may require this to be specified as <i>suMdari</i>. Here the <i>M</i> is to 
render as 
<span class="indic">&#x0CB8;&#x0CC1;&#x0C82;&#x0CA6;&#x0CB0;&#x0CBF;</span> in 
Kannada, or 
<span class="indic">&#x0C38;&#x0C41;&#x0C02;&#x0C26;&#x0C30;&#x0C3F;</span> in 
Telugu, with the anuswara following <i>su</i> as in 
<span class="indic">&#x0CB8;&#x0CC1;&#x0C82;</span>/<span class="indic">&#x0C38;&#x0C41;&#x0C02;</span>.
Even a Tamil transliteration scheme may require this to be specified as 
<i>su~ndari</i> with say <i>%n</i> (an arbitrary chosen representation) required
for the character <span class="indic">&#x0BA8;&#x0BCD;</span>, differentiating 
it from <i>n</i> which would stand for 
<span class="indic">&#x0BA9;&#x0BCD;</span>. Here both Tamil characters carry 
the same sound, but the former one is used only when preceding 
<span class="indic">&#x0BA4;</span> variant as here. However both 
<i>suMdari</i> and <i>su%ndari</i> diverge away from a "fairer" phonetic 
representation. In the scheme here, you can simply specify <i>sundari</i>, and 
it will be rendered correctly in all the languages.</li>
<li>Another example is the word <i></i> (poison) in Tamil, which is written as 
<span class="indic">&#x0BA8;&#x0B9E;&#x0BCD;&#x0B9A;&#x0BC1;</span>. Here the 
<i>nj</i> sound is represented as 
<span class="indic">&#x0B9E;&#x0BCD;&#x0B9A;&#x0BCD;</span>, and some schemes 
may require this to be specified explicitly (e.g. <i>na~jcU</i>/<i>na~ncu</i>, 
with <i>~j</i>/<i>~n</i> for <span class="indic">&#x0B9E;&#x0BCD;</span> and 
<i>cu</i> for <span class="indic">&#x0B9A;&#x0BC1;</span>). However, 
<i>na~jcu</i>/<i>na~ncu</i> as it appears in English, is far from being a fair 
phonetic representation of the pronounciation of the word it represents. It 
also leads to incorrect pronounciation in other languages, which would need 
the <i>ja</i> letter (but the <i>ja</i> letter would be inappropriate for 
tamizh here). In the scheme here, you can simply specify <i>nanju</i>, which 
is phonetically correct and the smart engine, will make sure it is rendered 
correctly in all target languages</li>.
<li>Finally, let us take the example of 
<span class="indic">&#x0B95;&#x0BBE;&#x0BB1;&#x0BCD;&#x0BB1;&#x0BC1;</span> in
Tamil, meaning <i>wind</i>. The sound of the 
<span class="indic">&#x0BB1;&#x0BCD;</span> here is really 
<span class="indic">&#x0B9F;&#x0BCD;</span>. Many schemes may however require 
the transliteration text to be specified as <i>kARRu</i>, again to make it 
represent how it is written. In the unified scheme, this is not desirable for 
two reasons: (a) <i>kARRu</i> is a poor phonetic representation of the 
underlying word (b) it will translate incorrectly to other languages unless 
special logic is added. Hence, in the scheme, you specify it as <i>kATRu</i>. 
This is an example of the general rule of thumb mentioned above: <i>try to 
represent the underlying sound of the word, and not how the word is written in 
a target language</i>
</ul>
<h4>Anuswaras - When to specify them explicitly?</h4>
The scripts of all target languages except Tamil have the anuswara character, and the scheme does
allow for explicit specification of the anuswara character. However, its usage should be carefully
considered and used only in places where it is absolutely needed. The reasons for this is explained
below.
<p>
Firstly, the anuswara usage varies significantly among the target languages. Secondly, in these languages
(except classical sanskrit?), the anuswara does not represent a separate sound/phoneme, but instead 
stands for 
<span class="scheme">#n</span>, <span class="scheme">~n</span>, <span class="scheme">n</span>,
<span class="scheme">N</span>, <span class="scheme">n</span>, or <span class="scheme">m</span>. 
Hence, the anuswara can be considered an artifact of the script, and avoided in the input text, which
should try to represent the underlying sound of a word, rather than how it is written in any particular
target language. This is all the more important because the different languages follow different rules, 
and anuswara figuring in a certain context in a certain language do not mean it will also figure 
in that context in a different language.
<p>
However, for some contexts, it is not possible for the editor to easily figure out if anuswara should
be used or not. Hence, the explicit specification of anuswara is not completely avoidable.  However,
it is strongly recommended that it be avoided wherever possible as explained later.
<h5>Explicit Anuswara Specifier Representation in the Scheme</h5>
The scheme provides three different ways for specifying the anuswara 
<span class="scheme">`n</span>, <span class="scheme">`N</span>, <span class="scheme">M</span>,
as opposed to just <span class="scheme">M</span> that many standard schems employ. The reason for this
variety is to avoid the explicit anuswara specification from hiding the underlying phoneme so that the
input text still is a phonetically fair (in english) representation of the underlying word. For example
<span class="scheme">sa`ngIta</span> is better than <span class="scheme">saMgIta</span>. Here are
the recommendations as to which anuswara specifier to use when
<ul>
<li>Use <span class="scheme">`n</span> when the anuswara represents
<span class="scheme">#n</span>, <span class="scheme">~n</span>, or <span class="scheme">n</span> sound. For example,
<span class="scheme">sa`ngIta</span> instead of <span class="scheme">saMgIta</span>, <span class="scheme">sa`ncAri</span>
instead of <span class="scheme">saMcAri</span>, and <span class="scheme">sa`ntOsha</span> instead of 
<span class="scheme">saMtOsha</span>.
<li>Use <span class="scheme">`N</span> when the anuswara represents <span class="scheme">N</span> sound. For example,
<span class="scheme">sa`NDIna</span> instead of <span class="scheme">saMDIna</span>.
<li>Use <span class="scheme">M</span> when the anuswara represents <span class="scheme">m</span> sound.
</ul>
<h5>Using explicit Anuswara Specifier in Kannada/Telugu</h5>
In kannada and telugu, the anuswara in the script follows these rules:
<ol>
<li>Anuswara is <u>always</u> used instead of <span class="scheme">m</span> at end of words.
<li>Anuswara is <u>always</u> used instead of <span class="scheme">#n</span> when preceding 
<span class="scheme">k</span>/<span class="scheme">kh</span>/<span class="scheme">g</span>/<span class="scheme">gh</span>.
<li>Anuswara is <u>always</u> used instead of <span class="scheme">~n</span> when preceding 
<span class="scheme">c</span>/<span class="scheme">ch</span>/<span class="scheme">j</span>/<span class="scheme">jh</span>.
<li>Anuswara is <u>always</u> used instead of <span class="scheme">n</span> when preceding 
<span class="scheme">t</span>/<span class="scheme">th</span>/<span class="scheme">d</span>/<span class="scheme">dh</span>.
<li>Anuswara is <u>always</u> used instead of <span class="scheme">N</span> when preceding 
<span class="scheme">T</span>/<span class="scheme">Th</span>/<span class="scheme">D</span>/<span class="scheme">Dh</span>.
<li>Anuswara is <u>always</u> used instead of <span class="scheme">m</span> when preceding 
<span class="scheme">p</span>/<span class="scheme">ph</span>/<span class="scheme">b</span>/<span class="scheme">bh</span>.
<li>Anuswara is <u>sometimes</u> used (depending on the word) instead of <span class="scheme">m</span> when preceding 
other consonants such as <span class="scheme">y</span>, <span class="scheme">r</span> etc. (for example, <span class="scheme">saMyukta</span>)
</ol>
Since for the first 6 rules the anuswara is <u>always</u> implied, it is strong recommended that
you not use the explicit anuswara specifier in these contexts. Note that this does imply that 
certain Sanskrit based words when translated to sanskrit may not appear with anuswara when it
should have. For example, it <span class="scheme">sa#nga</span>, but <span class="scheme">sa`ngIta</span>
in sanskrit. But both would be written with anuswara in kannada and telugu. A careful user can
explicitly specify the anuswara if a better translation to sanskrit is desired.
<p>
For cases covered by the 6th rule, explicit anuswara specifier needs to be specified wheverer applicable.
<h5>Using explicit Anuswara Specifier in Sanskrit</h5>
In sanskrit, there are no contexts in which anuswara <u>always</u> figures. Instead it depends
on the word. Anuswara at end of words, also follow different rules according to different
conventions:
<ul>
    <li>Anuswara is used for words ending in <span class="scheme">m</span> which are in 
        the middle of sentence. Anuswara is not used at end of sentences.
    <li>Anuswara is always used for words ending in <span class="scheme">m</span>
    <li>Anuswara is never used for words ending in <span class="scheme">m</span>
</ul>
<p>
In Sanskrit, it is up to the user to explicitly specify the anuswara where it is applicable. 
<h5>Using explicit Anuswara Specifier in Malayalam</h5>
Malayalam is similar to sanskrit except that it does not use anuswara at end of words,
and also uses anuswara in the middle of words but in fewer possible contexts. 
<p>
In Malayalam, like Sanskrit, it is up to the user to explicitly specify the anuswara where 
it is applicable. 
<h4>Qualifiers</h4>
The unified transliteration scheme for carnatic music uses <i>qualifiers</i> 
in the form of super-script numbers for the following purposes:
<ol>
<li>Represent sounds that are not part of the language
<li>Resolve any ambiguities in the letters of the script (as in the case of 
Tamil)
</ol>
For languages other than Tamil, there is only one case where qualifiers 
are used. That is the Kannada and Telugu representation of the <i>za/zgha</i>, 
which occurs in Tamil and Malayalam.  For Tamil, qualifiers are needed in many 
more contexts because both case #1 and case #2 arise when representing lyrics 
from other languages. For information on when qualifiers apply, please refer 
to the scheme.
