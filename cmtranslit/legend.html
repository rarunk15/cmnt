"The unified transliteration scheme for carnatic music uses qualifiers in the form of super-script numbers (e.g. " +
indic(tm("kha","natural")) + ", " + indic(kn("za")) + ") for the following purposes:" +
'<ol>\
<li>Represent sounds that are not part of the language\
<li>Resolve any ambiguities in the letters of the script (as in the case of Tamil)\
</ol>\
<p>\
It should be noted that <u>the qualifier for a certain consonant/vowel (i.e. sound) assigned \
by the transliteration scheme is fixed and constant</u>. This is so even in the case of Tamil, \
where there are <i>qualifier schemes</i> that may deem a certain qualifier to be not shown in \
certain contexts. So in tamil, for example the qualifiers for ' + 
schchoice('ka, kha, ga, gha', ',') + ' are always 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. Some will always \
appear, and others may not always but when they do they will have the pre-assigned number.\
<p>\
For languages other than tamil, there is only one case where qualifiers are used. That is the kannada and \
telugu representation of the ' + 
schchoice('za/zha') + ' consonant which occurs in tamil and malayalam. So this is a case of #1 above.' + '\
<h4>Tamil Qualifiers and Qualifier Schemes</h4>\
In the case of tamil, both cases #1 and #2 above are present. We have several letters that can represent \
different sounds depending on the context in which they occur it as per certain rules of the language (although \
these rules are applicable for native tamil words as opposed to imports). Also, the tamil language does not include several sounds found in the other languages like ' + schchoice('kha/gha/jha/bha/pha') + ' etc. The \
transliteration scheme uses qualifiers for both cases. \
As indicated above, while the qualifier for a certain consonant/vowel in the scheme (i.e. sound) is always \
fixed, whether the qualifier is shown or not can be controlled by choosing one of three \
qualifier schemes:\
<ul>\
<li style="padding-bottom:1em;"><b><i>Scheme</i>: None implies harder sounds</b>: In this scheme, qualifiers are always generated for the \
softer sounds ' + schchoice('ga/Da/da/ba') + ' no matter where they occur. Also, qualifiers \
would be included for sounds that are not part of the tamil language, \
no matter where they occur.\
<li style="padding-bottom:1em;"><b><i>Scheme</i>: Qualifiers only when sounds deviate from natural tamil rules</b>: As indicated earlier, when a particular tamil character \
like ' + indicl(tm('ka')) + ' takes the sound of ' + sch('ka') + ' vs when it takes the sound of ' +
sch('ga') + ' \
follows certain rules which are followed by most tamil words (except imported ones which have \
retained much of their original pronounciation). The harder sounds ' + schchoice('ka/Ta/ta/pa') + ' would \
be used at the beginning of the word. The softer sounds ' + schchoice('ga/Da/da/ba') + ' would occur \
in  the middle of the words <u>except</u> when following a mei of the same kind. One exception is the letter ' +
indicl(tm('sa')) + ', which can represent either the ' + sch('sa') + ' or ' + sch('ca') + ' sounds. In \
modern practice, at the beginning of the words also, the letter does take the soft sound. It takes \
the harder sound only in the middle when preceding a mei ' + indicl(tm('accu','natural').substring(1,3)) + '. \
<p>\
The <i>Qualifiers only when sounds deviate when natural tamil rules</i> scheme will not put \
qualifiers when the word follows these rules. For example, words like ' +
schchoice('kAviyam, pakkam, nAgam, paTTam, pattu, sAvi', ',') + ' etc. conform to these rules and will \
be rendered without qualifiers. This will be true for most tamil words in a tamil composition. \
<p> \
Instead, the scheme will put qualifiers if the \
sound occurs contrary to these rules. This can happen for some Tamil words as in ' + 
 sch('dAgam') + ' => ' + indicl(tm('dAgam','natural')) + ', where \
the softer sound occurs at the beginning, and of course can happen more often for non-Tamil words as in ' +
sch('pankajam') + ' => ' + indicl(tm('pankajam','natural')) + ', and ' + sch('vAtApi') +
' => ' + indicl(tm('vAtApi','natural')) + '\
, where the harder sounds ' + sch('ka') + ', ' + sch('tA') + ' and ' + sch('pi') + ' \
occur in the middle without being preceded by a ' + indicl(tm('akka').substring(1,3)) + ' and ' +
indicl(tm('atta').substring(1,3)) + ', and ' + indicl(tm('appa').substring(1,3)) + ' respectively.\
<p>\
Note that for sounds that are not part of the tamil language, the scheme will include qualifiers \
no matter where they occur. For example, ' + schchoice('bhAvamu, nAbhi', ',') + ' would be rendered as ' +
indicl(tm('bhAvamu','natural')) + ' and ' + indicl(tm('nAbhi','natural')) + ' respectively. Similarly, ' +
sch('mR.du') + ' would be rendered as ' + indicl(tm('mR.du','natural')) + '. Note here that ' +
sch('R.') + ' carries a slightly different pronounciation from ' + sch('Ru') + '.\
	<li "style=padding-bottom:1em;"><b><i>Scheme:</i> No Qualifiers</b>: This implies no qualifiers would be shown. This \
may be useful for tamil krithis, where the reader does not want any qualifiers.\
