<h3 style="page-break-before:always;">Songbreak Directive</h3>
The <span class="syntax2">Songbreak</span> directive is used to force a
break in the current notation line and start a new tala cycle. It is 
generally not needed as a break is introduced automatically whenever a 
heading directive is seen.  However, there may be situations where 
you want to explicitly break a notation in the middle of a tala cycle.
Also when using "Manual" tala (see <b>Tala Directive</b>), this directive
is the only way to force the typesetter to start a new line of notations.
<p>
There is no value for the directive and so its syntax is as follows:
<p>
<span class="syntax2">SongBreak</span>
</p>
