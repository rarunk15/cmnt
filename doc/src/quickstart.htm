<h3>Quick Start through an example</h3>
To understand and quickly become familiar with the input format, let us look at 
an example. Here is a short snippet of a song specified using an input format, and
how it is rendered by the typesetter:
<p>
<div style="padding-left:0.25in;">
<table class="mytable" style="width:5in;">
<tr class="mytr">
<td style="padding:5 5 5 5;">
<span style="font-size:8pt;">Input Format</span>
<td>
<div class="sc">
<span id="ex1" class="syntax2">Tala: Adi

<span style="font-size:8pt;">
Typesetter Output
</span>
<td width="50%">
<span class="songfragment" id="ex1_v">
<script language="javascript">
renderSongFragment("ex1_v", "ex1");
</script>
</span>
</table>
</div>
<p>
Let us now look at the input line by line.
<p>
<hr>
<span class="syntax">#1: <span class="syntax2">Tala: Adi</span></span><br>
This line contains a <i>Tala directive</i> that specifies catuSra gati Adi 
tala as the tala for the song. Specifying the tala also controls how the 
typesetter should layout the notation of the song and when and where 
tala markers need to be placed. Check out the <b>Tala Directive</b> section 
below for more information on the the various talas that can be specified 
using the tala directive.
<p>
<hr>
<span class="syntax"><span class="syntax2">#2: Heading: "brOva bhAramA - bahudAri - Adi - tyAgarAja",bold,italic,14,center</span><br>
<span class="syntax2">#3: Heading: ""</span><br>
<span class="syntax2">#4: Heading: "pallavi:",bold,left,12</span></span><br>
These line contain <i>Heading directives</i>. Line #2 directs the typesetter 
to place the text <i>brOva bhArama - bahudAri - Adi - tyAgarAja</i> in 
14 point size, bold, and italic and centered on the notation display area.
You can see in the typesetter output area above that this is how the heading 
appears.
<p>
Line #3 specifies an heading directive with an empty heading. This simply results
in an empty line in the typeset output, and can be used to introduce empty 
vertical space wherever needed. 
<p>
Finally, Line #4 directs the typesetter to place a heading <i>pallavi:</i> in 12 
point size, bold and aligned at the left edge of the display. 
<p>
Check out the <b>Heading Directive</b> section below for more information on
the heading directive. The above examples are very simple and basic. There is a
lot of power and flexibility available in specifying a heading, which 
you can use to specify mixed bold, italic and underlined,  text in various 
colors,  text that is tabular (i.e. rendered as a table), or text that is
translated to an Indic language, or even insert an image!
<p>
<hr>
<span class="syntax">#5: <span class="syntax2">S: "1)" ; , ( p   d  n , ) pa  m  | ga , g | m   pa  , ||</span><br><br>...<br>
#7: <span class="syntax2">S: "2)" m~  , , ( p   d  n  s' n p   ; ) m  | ga , g | m   pa  , ||</span></span><br>
These lines start with <span class="syntax2">S:</span>, a <i>Swara directive</i>,
which specifies notation i.e. swaras for the song. Here are some key points to note
in the syntax used to specify swaras:
<ul>
<li><i>Swara Labels</i>:
<span class="syntax2">s</span>, 
<span class="syntax2">r</span>, <span class="syntax2">g</span>, 
<span class="syntax2">m</span> etc. indicate swaras, and 
<span class="syntax2">sa</span>, <span class="syntax2">ri</span>, 
<span class="syntax2">ga</span>, <span class="syntax2">ma</span> etc. indicate
dhIrgha or elongated swaras. You can also specify a dhIrgha swara as 
<span class="syntax2">n</span>, instead of <span class="syntax2">ni</span>. 
<li>
<li><i>Tara/Mandra Stayi Swaras</i>:
To indicate a swara in tara stayi, use the forward-tick character as a suffix 
as in <span class="syntax2">s<b>'</b></span> (as in Line #7) or 
<span class="syntax2">sa<b>'</b></span>.  Similarly to indicate a swara in mandra 
stayi, use the backward-tick character as <span class="syntax2">p<b>`</b></span> or 
<span class="syntax2">pa<b>`</b></span>.
<li><i>Pauses, Continuations</i>: The comma (<span class="syntax2"><b>,</b></span>), and 
semi-colon (<span class="syntax2"><b>;</b></span>) are pauses/continuations, with the 
latter being twice as long in duration as the former.
<li><i>Switching speed/kAlam</i>:
The parenthesis characters <span class="syntax2"><b>(</b></span>, and 
<span class="syntax2"><b>)</b></span> are used to switch from normal speed to 
higher speeds. But what is the normal speed? Since the above example did not 
explicitly specify a layout (see <b>Layout Directive</b> below), the default
layout is <i>krithi layout</i>. In the krithi layout, for catuSra gati (i.e. as
per tala specified), swaras by default are in second speed i.e. 2 swaras per 
akshara. So in the above example, the swaras outside of paranthese are in
the default, second speed. However, phrases <span class="syntax2">p d n , </span>
on line #5, and <span class="syntax2">p d n s' n pa ; </span> on line #7 are in
third speed, and thus are rendered as such in the output. Note that the paranthesis
must be separated by spaces on either side.
<li><i>Tala Markers</i>:
The special characters <span class="syntax2">|</span>, and 
<span class="syntax2">||</span> indicate tala markers but they are only for
clarity in the input for you as the user. They are simply skipped by the 
typesetter which automatically determines where tala markers fall for the 
current tala based on the duration of the swaras. In other words, you dont have
to specify these in the input, their presence/absence has no effect on the 
typeset output, but having them there may allow the input to be
more understandable.
<li><i>Sangati Labels</i>:
Both the above swara directives here begin with a quoted string,
which is a special indicator telling the typesetter to attach a label to the 
left of the swara lines (and their associated lyric lines). The labels here are
<i>1)</i> and <i>2)</i> respectively, and in this example are used to indicate
the first and second sangatis of the pallavi. 
<li><i>Gamaka specifiers</i>:
Following the swara and the stayi suffix, certain characters or patterns are 
allowed to indicate standard gamakas. In the example above, on Line #7, the 
<span class="syntax2">m~</span>, with the tilde/wavy-line character (~) after m, 
indicates the <i>kampita</i> gamaka for that madhyama swara. You can see in 
the rendition that the gamaka is rendered as a glyph above the swara as shown
in the typesetter output area above.
<ul>
<li>See the <b>Swara Directive</b> section below for more information on how to 
specify gamakas. You can use special characters like ~ that map to specific 
predefined glyphs, and also specify anuswaras.
</ul>
</ul>
Check out the <b>Swara Directive</b> section below for more information.
<p>
Let us move on to the next couple of lines in the input.
<p>
<hr>
<span class="syntax">#6: <span class="syntax2">L: _ _   brO _ va _   bhA ra   mA _ ra  ghu rA  ,</span><br><br>...<br>
#8: <span class="syntax2">L:      mA . .   brO _  vA .  . bhA _   ra   mA _ ra  ghu rA  ,</span><br></span><p>
These lines starts with <span class="syntax2">L:</span>, a <i>lyric 
directive</i>, which specifies lyrics associated with the swaras for the
previous <i>swara directive</i> seen. Lyrics for the swaras are separated by 
one or more spaces. It is important to note that you <b>must</b> specify 
one lyric for every swara (including pauses) in the swara line. An empty 
lyric can be specified using the underscore character 
(<span class="syntax2">_</span>) as employed in this example. 
It is also not uncommon to use a period (<span class="syntax2">.</span>)
instead, particularly if the corresponding swara/continuation should be emphasized
as with gamaka.
<p>
<i>It is not necessary to align the lyrics</i> against the swaras in the corresponding
swara directive as done in the example above. The typesetter will automaticallly
align them in the typeset output as shown above. Of course it makes the input a
lot more readable if the lyrics are aligned against the swaras using spaces. Note
also that in the typesetter program has a button that can automatically align the
raw input itself automatically for you.
