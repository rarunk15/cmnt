<h3 style="page-break-before:always;">DefaultSpeed Directive</h3>
The <span class="syntax2">DefaultSpeed</span> directive controls what the default speed
of the swaras in a Swara Directive are. The speed here implies the duration of the swara.
The typesetter current supports 3 speeds:
<ul>
<li><b>0</b> - which implies what is colloquially known as first speed, where each swara spans
a full akshara.
<li><b>1</b> - which implies what is colloquially known as second speed, where e.g. in 
catusra gati, each swara spans half an aksara, or 2 swaras taken up an akshara. Note that
in this speed for tIsra gati, 3 swaras take up 1 akshara. Similarly for khaNDa, miSra
and sankIrNa gati, it would be 5, 7 and 9 swaras per akshara respectively.
<li><b>2</b> - which implies what is colloquially known as third speed, where e.g. in 
catusra gati, each swara spans quarter of an aksara, or 4 swaras taken up an akshara.
For tiSra, khaNDa, miSra and sankIrNa gati it would be  6, 10, 14 and 19 swaras.
</ul>
<p>
Note that depending on the layout (see Layout directive), an appropriate default speed
is automatically set for you. The DefaultSpeed directive can be used to override that
default. The value of the DefaultSpeed directive must be one of the above speeds. This
implies that swaras at higher speeds will be shown with speed lines (above or below -
see SpeedMarks directive). Note that there is no way to specify a speed that is
<i>slower</i> than the default, and so e.g. if you pick a default speed as 1, then
there is no way to specify swaras of speed 0. Hence you should pick such a speed
only if there is no such need.
<p>
Here are some examples of usage of the DefaultSpeed directive. The varnam layout (see <b>Layout
Directive</b>, while it may not be most appropriate to show various speeds, is used
here for illustrative purposes, as it makes the typesetter show each akshara clearly:
