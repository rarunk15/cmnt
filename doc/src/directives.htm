<h2 style="page-break-before:always;">Directives - in detail</h2>
Each line of the input format contains a directive. The syntax of a directive 
is the directive name, followed by a colon, which is then followed by the 
directive value:<br>
<div class="sc"><span class="syntax">directive_name:directive_value</span></div>
<p>
For example:
<div class="sc">
<span class="syntax">Tala: Adi
S: s r g m | p d | n s
</span>
</div>
<p>
<b><i>Directive names are case insensitive</i></b>. There can be spaces around the colon 
separating the directive name and the value. Also in most places, more than
one space is <=> one space. So all the following <i>Tala</i> and <i>S</i> 
(for swaras) directives are equivalent to each other:
<div class="sc">
<span class="syntax">tala: Adi
	tALa: Adi
	Tala: Adi
	Tala : Adi
	Tala:                      Adi
	Tala            :     Adi

	S: s r g m | p d | n s
	S: s   r   g   m | p d |   n s
</span>
</div>
Spacing is flexible so that you can give whatever spacing that is needed to make the input format
itself readable.
<p>
<b><i>Header vs. Body section</i></b>: The specification of the song in this format 
is roughly divided into 2 sections: <ul>
<li>The header portion where you specify overall attributes for the song. Certain
<i>directives</i> must appear in the header portion only.
<li>The main body where you specify the swaras and the associated lyrics. You
can also specify headings for different portions of the song here. Certain
<i>directives</i> cannot appear in the body portion and must appear only in
the header portion
</ul>
<p>
There is no clear demarcation between the header and the body portion. Basically the
first heading or swara or lyric signals the start of the body portion.
