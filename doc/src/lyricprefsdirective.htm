<h3 style="page-break-before:always;">LyricPrefs Directive</h3>
The <span class="syntax2">LyricPrefs</span> directive can be set the default preferences for
subsequent Lyric directives such as the default font size, and default font/text color. The
syntax of the <span class="syntax2">LyricPrefs</span> directive is as follows:
<div class="sc"><span class="syntax2">LyricPrefs: attributes</span></div>
where <i>attributes</i> is a comma separated list of one or more of the following:<ul>
<li><i>font size</i>: The default point size of the lyrics as a number
<li><i>color</i>: The color of the text of the lyrics. This can either be a color name 
such as <i>green</i>, <i>blue</i> or a RGB (red, green, blue) combination.
</ul>
<p>
Here are some examples of usages of the <span class="syntax2">LyricPrefs</span> directive:
<p>
<table class="mytable" style="font-size:100%;width:100%;">
<tr class="mytr">
<td>
<span class="syntax2">LyricPrefs: 12</span>
<td>
Sets the default point size for lyrics to 12pt.
<tr class="mytr">
<td>
<span class="syntax2">LyricPrefs: 12,red</span>
<td>
Sets the default point size for lyrics to 12pt and color to red.
<tr class="mytr">
<td>
<span class="syntax2">LyricPrefs: 12,rgb(64,100,125)</span>
<td>
Sets the default point size for lyrics to 12pt, and the color to a a color 
whose red-component is 64, blue component is 100, and green component is 125. 
The <i>rgb(red,green.blue)</i> of color specification takes a value between
0 and 255 for each of the red, green and blue component. The maximum value
of 255 for all three i.e. rgb(255,255,255) is white, the minimum value of 0
for all three i.e. rgb(0,0,0) is black. All the colors of the spectrum fall
between these two and take varying values for these three components.
</table>
<p>
Note that if no LyricPrefs directive is given, the default font size is
taken to be 10pt, and color to be black.
