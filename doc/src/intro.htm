<h2>Synopsis</h2>
The <i>Carnatic Music Notation Typesetter</i> is a web-based application that 
allows you to create high quality notation sheets for carnatic music. It can 
generate notations in English, and if appropriate fonts are installed on your 
computer, it can even generate notation sheets in the following Indic 
languages: Sanskrit, Telugu, Tamil and Kannada.
<p>
The typesetter requires you to specify the notation for the song to be notated
in a specific input format that is simple, and easy to use. The application 
converts the input into a graphical layout similar to those you see in 
carnatic music books. This manual describes the input format in detail.

<i><b>Browser Support:</b> Firefox is currently the preferred browser to run the
typsetter. However, typesetter should work on Internet Explorer and Opera.
As indicated above, due to the typesetter being in Beta release, you may 
still run into problems on these browsers.  It is the intention of the
author(s) to support the typesetter on Firefox, Opera, IE and Safari (on Mac).</i>

<h3>What's new in this release</h3>
The 1.5 beta version of typesetter introduces the following new features:
<ul>
<li>A <b>Smart Lyric mode</b> which allows you to specify lyrics more easily. See the <b>SmartLyricMode Directive</b> section.
<li>Enhancements to manual mode in tala - see the <b>Tala Directive</b>, and the <b>LineBreak Directive</b> sections.
<li>Support for rendering language using Roman diacritics - see the <b>Language Directive</b> section.
<li><i>Pagination behavior changes</i>: Due to lack of reliable pagination control (as well as 
browser incompatiblities), starting with v1.5 Beta, the typesetter does not automatically paginate 
contents like in earlier versions (since that has proven to be very unreliable).
The typesetter now instead relies on the browser's printing capabilities itself. 
This may however result in browser inserting a page break at inappropriate places 
(e.g. between the swara line and the corresponding lyric line). To fix these,
you can insert the <span class="syntax2">Pagebreak</span> directive to introduce
a manual pagebreak.  
<li>Better control over the width and height of margins around the content can be controlled. See the <b>Orientation Directive</b> section.
<li><span class="syntax2">Title</span> directive to specify the title of the web-page. This can be useful in
printing as the browser can be directed to put this information in the header/footer sections. See 
the <b>Title Directive</b> section.
<li>The release also has some bug fixes with respect to layout and pagination.
</ul>
