<h2 style="page-break-before:always;">Assistance in entering directives</h2>
As mentioned earlier, the input area of the typesetter application has an <b>Assist</b> button
that can assist you in entering new directives, and editing already specified directives making
it easy to specify the notation information without having to memorize the syntax of the various
directives.  There are two kinds of assistance:
<ul>
    <li><b>Directive specific dialogs/forms:</b> Here assistance is provided via dialogs/forms
    specific to a directive. 
    <p>
    In the example below, the <b>Assist</b> button is pressed when the cursor on an empty line:
	<p><center><img src="select_directive.png"/>
		<br><b style="font-size: 10pt;padding-top:5;padding-bottom:5;">Fig A1</b></center>
    <p>
    As shown above, a dialog that asks you to select a directive that you wish to add is shown.
    Pick a directive and click OK, and a dialog specific to that directive will be displayed. 
    <p>
    In the second example below, after "Heading: " was typed on a new line, the <b>
	Assist</b> button was pressed:
	<p><center><img src="newheading.png"/>
		<br><b style="font-size: 10pt;padding-top:5;padding-bottom:5;">Fig A1</b></center>
    <p>As shown above, a form for entering the heading is shown. Here you can specify the 
    heading text, the alignment, the formatting etc. After entering that, if you click "ok", 
    then the contents of heading directive is appropriately constructed and placed in the
    text area as shown below:
	<p><center><img src="newheading2.png"/>
	    <br><b style="font-size: 10pt;padding-top:5;padding-bottom:5;">Fig A2</b></center>
    <p>
    You can bring up the assistance dialogs when the line where the cursor is in the input 
    area is one of the foollowing:
    <ul>
	<li>An empty line. In this case, as explained above a dialog that lets you firsy
	pick a directive would be shown.
	<li>Contains just the directive name: The dialog specific to the directive would be
	shown and you can specify all the parameters for the directive.
	<li>Contains a complete valid directive: Again, the dialog specific to the directive 
	would be shown, and you can change the already specified parameters.
    </ul>
    <p>
    <li><b>Inline assistance (TAB completion):</b> Once you get familiar with the syntax 
    of the directives, some may find it faster to type in the raw directives rather than 
    use the forms. You can press the tab key while typing in the directive, and the application
    should complete the directive information wherever appropriate. For example, if on
    a new line, you enter just the letter "t" and than press the TAB key (see Fig A3 below), 
    the application will immediately fill "Tala: " as a beginning of a tala directive (see Fig
    A4 below). Then for the value for the tala directive, if for example, you enter "k" and 
    press TAB (Fig A5 below), the application will fill in "KhandaCapu" (Fig A6 below).
