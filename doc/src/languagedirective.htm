<h3 style="page-break-before:always;">Language Directive</h3>
The <span class="syntax2">Language</span> directive specifies two things:
<ol>
<li> The language in which to render the swaras (specified by Swara Directives) 
and lyrics (specified by Lyric Directives). 
<li> The <i>default</i> language in which to render the headings and other
text specified by the Heading Directives. Note that <i>default</i> here
implies that this is the language that will be in effect for an heading
unless the Heading directive overrides it. Hence it is possible to include
headings in different languages.
</ol>
<p>
Using this directive you can tell the typesetter to show your notations 
and headings in English with diacritics, Sanskrit, Telugu, Tamil or Kannada. Note that for 
Lyric and Heading Directives, the typesetter would presume that lyrics are 
specified in the <b>Unified Transliteration Scheme for Carnatic Music Compositions</b>, 
and translate to the specified language for rendering.
<p>
If no Language directive is specified, swaras and lyrics are rendered as
specified in input i.e. in English.

<h4>Extra language attributes</h4>
The <span class="syntax2">Language</span> directive allows you to specify certain
extra attributes in the language value, which control how the content in that
language is rendered. A language directive with attribute values has the
following syntax:
<div class="sc">
<span class="syntax2">Language: your_language:attr1:attr2</span>
</div>
where, 
<ul>
    <li><span class="syntax2">your_language</span> is one of 
	<span class="syntax2">Sanskrit Telugu Tamil Kannada English</span>
    <li><span class="syntax2">attr1</span> is the first attribute, and
	    <span class="syntax2">attr2</span> is the second attribute etc.
</ul>
<p>
Currently the following attributes are supported:
<ul>
    <li>One of <span class="syntax2">noqual nohard</span> to specify a Tamil
    qualifier scheme - see <b>Tamil Qualifier Scheme</b> below for more information.
    <li><span class="syntax2">granthasa,nogranthasa</span>, which is applicable only to
    Tamil. It directs the typesetter to use or not use the 
    <span style="font-family:code2000;">&#x0bb6;</span> character for 
    <b>Sa</b> (as in Siva, Sakthi). The default is to not use, which implies 
    <span style="font-family:Code2000;">&#x0bb8;<sub>2</sub></span> is used for <b>Sa</b>. 
    Note however that the <span style="font-family:Code2000;">&#x0bb6;</span> character is 
    a fairly recent addition to Unicode (in 2006) and hence it is supported only in a few
    systems at this time. So you should use the <span class="syntax2">granthasa</span> specifier only
    if your system can support it. Here are the current known configurations in which this character
    is supported:
    <ul>
	<li>On Microsoft Vista, there is support at the system level for this character.
	The Latha font that is part of the OS supports this font.  The system support is
	by the Unicode rendering engine called <i>Uniscribe</i>, which is in the dll 
	<i>usp10.dll</i>. The version of the dll that ships with Vista has this support
	<li>On Microsoft XP, if Office 2007 is installed then the Unicode
	rendering engine that is part of the Office 2007 at this time. However,
	the rendering engine that is in use for the rest of the system is an older
	version and does <i>not</i> support it. To make say <i>FireFox</i>
	or <i>Opera</i> browsers to use the Office 2007's rendering engine, find
	the <i>usp10.dll</i> under the Office 2007 installation directory tree, 
	and copy the it into into the FireFox, Opera installation directory.
	<p>
	You would still need a Unicode font that supports the character. One such
	font is <i>Code2000</i>, which is a shareware font available for download
	at www.code2000.net.
    </ul>
    <li>A percentage value in the form <span class="syntax2">n%</span>
    This controls the size of the qualifiers shown for languages like Tamil 
    when displaying sounds not natural to the language. The qualifiers are shown 
    as sup-scripted numbers and normally are shown in a point size that is 
    closest 70% of the current font size. This may be too small or too big for
    some fonts depending on user preference. In such cases, the size of the
    qualifiers can be adjusted using this attribute in the <span class="syntax2">Language</span> directive.
</ul>
<p>
For example <span class="syntax2">Language: Tamil:granthasa:90%</span> asks the
typesetter to use <span style="font-family:Code2000;">&#x0bb6;</span> for <b>Sa</b>,
and also show qualifiers (e.g. for <b>kha</b>, <b>gha</b> etc.) with a font 
whose size is closest to 90% of the current font size for the Tamil language.
<h4>Need for explicit specifiers in Lyric directives</h4>
It would be common for lyric fragments (syllables) belonging to a word 
to be specified as separate entities separated by spaces if they are 
assigned to different swaras (as would be very common) - e.g. 
<span class=syntax2">ninnukOri</span> would appear as <span class="syntax2">nin nu kO ri</span>.
As a result, when applying interpreting a text in the Unified scheme
for translation to a language, the typesetter cannot rely on spaces
to imply word delimitors, and you may have to explicitly qualify 
certain letters so that the typesetter renders them properly. This is
explained in this expection.
<p>
<h4>Tamil: <span style="font-family:Code2000">&#x0ba8;</span> vs.  
    <span style="font-family:Code2000">&#x0ba9;</span>.</h4>
The Tamil script has two characters for the "na" sound - 
<span style="font-family:Code2000">&#x0ba8;</span> 
and 
<span style="font-family:Code2000">&#x0ba9;</span>.
The latter 
<span style="font-family:Code2000">&#x0ba9;</span>.
cannot appear at the beginning of the word. A phrase like say <i>manam nOgi</i> 
is written as <span style="font-family:Code2000">
&#x0BAE;&#x0BA9;&#x0BAE;&#x0BCD; &#x0BA8;&#x0BCB;&#x0B95;&#x0BBF;
</span>, wherein both characters figure. 
Note that at a word start like nOgi,
<span style="font-family:Code2000">&#x0ba8;</span> figures. 
Usually, in the Unified scheme,
if specify <i>manam nOgi</i> (say in a Heading Directive), the translator
will correctly translate as it would rely on space as word delimitor,
and know that for nO, it should use <span style="font-family:Code2000">&#x0ba8;</span>.
However, when appearing as lyrics in a notation as in a Lyric Directive, this phrase 
could appear as <span class="syntax2">L: ma na m nO gi</span> where the syllables are sung as 
separate swaras. Here, the typesetter cannot rely on spaces to determine
word breaks - as that would result in the incorrect conclusion that each
syllable is a separate word! Hence when interpreting lyric text, the 
typesetter <u>always</u> assumes <span class="syntax2">na</span> stands for 
<span style="font-family:Code2000">&#x0ba9;</span>, and to specify
<span style="font-family:Code2000">&#x0ba8;</span>, you need to explicitly
specify it as <span class="syntax2">^n</span> as in <span class="syntax2">ma na m ^nO gi</span>.
<p>
<h5>Use n2 as opposed to n^</h5>
Note that there are two was of specifying 
<span style="font-family:Code2000">&#x0ba8;</span>:  <span class="syntax2">n2</span> 
or <span class="syntax2">n^</span>. However, since the caret character 
(<span class="syntax2">^</span>) would be interpret as superscript indicator by
<b>Wiky</b>, it is safer to always use <span class="syntax2">n2</span> in Heading directives
<p>
<h4>Tamil Qualifier Schemes</h4>
As implied earlier, if you specify the language as <span class="syntax2">Tamil:noqual</span> then 
no numeric subscript qualifiers (to distinguish ka, ga etc.) would be used. 
Similarly <span class="syntax2">Tamil:nohard</span> would specify a qualifier scheme, where 
qualifiers are used for the softer ga (but not for ka), and of course for gha, and kha, 
which do not exist in tamil.
<p>
Note that <span class="syntax2">Tamil:natural</span> does exist for specifying a qualifier
scheme where qualifiers are used only when sounds deviate from natural tamil language rules
(e.g. gAnam where the soft gA occurs at the beginning of word and is not typical of native
tamil words), this scheme's effectiveness is nullified in the lyric line. This is because
the scheme relies on being able to reliably detect word beginnings, and as mentioned above,
that is not possible in the lyric line. However, you should be able use it in the Heading directives.

<p>
<h4>Anuswara</h4>
In languages like kannada and telugu, the anuswara character 
<span style="font-family:Code2000">&#x200d;&#x0c82;</span>  is used instead #n, ~n, n, N and m
in certain contexts. For example, in contexts shown in words <i>sa#ngIta</i>, 
<i>pa~nca</i>, <i>candra</i>, <i>khaNDa</i>, <i>amba</i> etc. the anuswara character is 
used instead of the #n, ~n, n and N respectively. Usually, in the Unified scheme, you can 
specify these words as their fair phoenetic representation rather than as 
<i>saMgIta, paMca, caMdra, khaMDa</i> and <i>aMba</i>. In fact, that is the recommended 
way as it facilitates easy translation to other languages which may have different 
anuswara rules. For example, Sanskrit has these same words but does not use the 
anuswara in every case.
<p>
When specifying lyrics, as indicated above, a single word may appear as multiple fragments 
separated by spaces. This means that you have to be careful as to whether the #n, ~n, n, N and m
is specified in a separate fragment from its trailing consonant, which actually determines
whether anuswara should be used. the translator will display the anuswara <u>only</u> if 
both are together. So while <span class="sc2">L: ca ndra</span> will still be rendered 
correctly with anuswara (<i>n</i> and the subsequent consonant <i>d</i> are
still together), <span class="syntax2">L: ca n dra</span>,  <span class="syntax2">L: ca n . d ra</span>
etc. will not. In such cases, you would need to explicitly specify the anuswara as in
<span class="syntax2">L: ca M dra</span>,  <span class="syntax2">L: ca M . dra</span>. 
Note however that this does compromise the ability to easily switch a notation to a 
different language.
