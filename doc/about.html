The <i>Carnatic Music Notation Typesetter</i> is a web-based application that 
allows you to create high quality notation sheets for carnatic music. It can 
generate notations in English, and if appropriate fonts are installed on your 
computer, it can even generate notation sheets in the following Indic 
languages: Sanskrit, Telugu, Tamil and Kannada.
<p>
The typesetter application currently is in Beta Release, which means it has 
some rough edges, and may not always be stable.
<p>
To know more about using the typesetter, please read the manual, and also look at
the examples. To use this program effectively, you need to learn about
how to specify the notation input. The manual explains this in detail,
and the examples are also a great way of learning how to specify Carnatic
Music notations.
